# StocksData
Program that collects live data on the stock market to create a selection of reasonably-priced stocks

## Alpha Vantage API
Necessary background about stocks: Stocks have a few different types of weekly price data, which includes low and high. Low price is the lowest price that a particular stock cost during a certain week, and similarly high is the highest price.

Original Goals:

Use the API from Alpha Vantage to gather data about the price of stocks(both high and
low) from the first week of 2020 and the latest week of 2020 in order to compare the two.

## Webpage: 100 Most Popular Stocks
Original Goals:

Use the data from the web page to create a database that tracks only specific
information such as the name, symbol, price, daily performance and ratings

Use that information to figure out how many popular stocks are affordable for college
students like me that don’t have a lot of money to invest. I do this by dividing up the
stocks by price ranges and use a pie chart to visualize the distribution

Use historical data to see the overall performance of the stocks over a period of time to
assess each individual stock’s stability
